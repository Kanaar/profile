      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Starting my career in chemical tanker chartering I figured that I was more interested in smoothening working methods rather than chartering vessels. I saw a lot of room for improvement with regards to software implementation which inspired me to learn coding. I wish to start a business offering applications for shipping and logistiscs oriented industries.

              <h3>Bernard Moitessier - The Long Way</h3>
              <p>The Long Way is Bernard Moitessier's own incredible story of his participation in the first Golden Globe Race, a solo, non-stop circumnavigation rounding the three great Capes of Good Hope, Leeuwin, and the Horn. For seven months, the veteran seafarer battled storms, doldrums, gear-failures, knock-downs, as well as overwhelming fatigue and loneliness. Then, nearing the finish, Moitessier pulled out of the race and sailed on for another three months before ending his 37,455-mile journey in Tahiti. Not once had he touched land.</p>
